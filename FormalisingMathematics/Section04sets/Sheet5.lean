# Sets in Lean, sheet 5 : equality of sets

Sets are extensional objects to mathematicians, which means that
if two sets have the same elements, then they are equal.

## Tactics

Tactics you will need to know for this sheet:

* `ext`

### The `ext` tactic

If the goal is `⊢ A = B` where `A` and `B` are subsets of `X`, then
the tactic `ext x,` will create a hypothesis `x : X` and change
the goal to `x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B`.

open Set

variable (X : Type)
  -- Everything will be a subset of `X`
  (A B C D E : Set X)
  -- A,B,C,D,E are subsets of `X`
  (x y z : X)

-- x,y,z are elements of `X` or, more precisely, terms of type `X`

example : A ⊆ B → B ⊆ A → A = B := by sorry

example : A ∩ B = B ∩ A := by sorry

example : A ∩ (B ∩ C) = A ∩ B ∩ C := by sorry

example : A ∪ (B ∪ C) = A ∪ B ∪ C := by sorry

example : A ∪ B ∩ C = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C) := by sorry

example : A ∩ (B ∪ C) = A ∩ B ∪ A ∩ C := by sorry
